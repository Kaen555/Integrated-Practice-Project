# Teamwork Contract for ADSC 3910 Project

## Expectations

* The time expected for group members to work on ADSC 3910 will be a maximum of 10 hours per week unless all the team members agree to lengthen the time expected.
* Each group member's assigned tasks should be completed at least 24 hours prior to the deliverable submission deadline. This will allow ample time for pull requests to be reviewed before submission.
* If team members cannot complete their tasks within the maximum weekly hours, members should give notice on Slack at least 24 hours before the deadline to see if work should be redistributed or if the expected time should be increased.
* All submissions are expected to meet the criteria of the deliverables as set out in the instructions.

## Mode of communication
The primary mode of communication would be Slack or Github. However, team members will meet at the campus after classes for brainstorming and distributing tasks if needed. Slack will be the communication tool for informal communication and scheduling meetings.

## Task management system

GitHub will be the primary communication tool for ideas, suggestions, submitting work, and reviewing work. There will be a project board set up in GitHub to track the tasks assigned to each person related to the deliverables. The tasks will be closed after the completion of the corresponding deliverable.

## Reviews

All members are expected to branch out from the `main` and submit a pull request to merge their work to the GitHub repository for the group project. Members are expected to add teammates as reviewers to have all pull requests reviewed by another teammate. Pull requests should be reviewed within 24 hours after creation.

## Breach of Contract

Failure to follow the team contract will result in a three-step warning system:

* The first step is a written Slack notice that outlines the violation of the team contract and a reminder of the team contract conditions.
* The second step is a meeting to discuss the behavior and write an agreement to follow the team contract that is required by the member.
* The third step is to reach out to the mentor about the issues with the teammate.
